# Crash Course through Angular

A quick crash course through Angular with the Task Tracker application. This application also includes the use of JSON-server for a mock back end.

This project is originally from Brad Traversy. For more details watch the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dHNOWTI7H8&list=WL&index=7) or see his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bradtraversy/angular-crash-2021).

This version of the project is built with strict mode enabled. 

There is only one noticeable change in the application. I have hidden the 'about' link once the user is on the 'about' page

## Usage Notes

### Angular Server

The server runs on (http://localhost:4200)

```
ng serve
```

### JSON Server

The server runs on (http://localhost:5000). Find more information [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).
